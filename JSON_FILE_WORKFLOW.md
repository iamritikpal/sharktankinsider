# JSON File Workflow - Shark Tank Treasures

## How It Works Now

The app now uses **only** the `public/data/products.json` file for all product data. No localStorage dependency.

### **Product Loading:**
- ✅ **Products Page**: Loads from `public/data/products.json`
- ✅ **Home Page**: Loads featured products from `public/data/products.json`
- ✅ **Admin Page**: Loads products from `public/data/products.json`

### **Admin Workflow:**
1. **Add/Edit Products**: Use the admin panel at `/admin`
2. **Auto Download**: When you save changes, a new `products.json` file is automatically downloaded
3. **Replace File**: Replace `public/data/products.json` with the downloaded file
4. **Refresh**: The changes are immediately visible everywhere

## **Current Products in JSON File:**
- Better Nutrition Biofortified Atta (Featured)
- Blue Tea Hibiscus Tea (Featured) 
- Blue Tea Butterfly Pea Flower Tea
- Good Monk Healthy 50+ Multivitamin (Featured)
- Good Monk Multivitamin & Probiotic Mix
- Good Monk Fiber Fix

## **Benefits:**
- ✅ **Consistent Data**: Same products shown everywhere
- ✅ **No localStorage Issues**: Works in incognito mode and production
- ✅ **Easy Deployment**: Just update the JSON file
- ✅ **Version Control**: JSON file can be tracked in Git
- ✅ **Backup**: Always have the latest products in the file

## **For Deployment:**
1. Make changes in admin panel
2. Download the updated JSON file
3. Replace `public/data/products.json` in your repository
4. Deploy - changes are live!

## **File Structure:**
```
public/
  data/
    products.json  ← Main product data file
    blogs.json     ← Blog data (unchanged)
```

The app is now completely independent of localStorage and uses only the JSON file for product data!
